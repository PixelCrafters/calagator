  <h2>What</h2>

  <p>VanCal is a unified calendar for the web, software, and design craftspeople of Vancouver, BC, Canada. We are an all-volunteer effort and encourage anyone to import, create, and edit events. Calagator also refers to the open source software running this site.</p>

  <p>VanCal aggregates events so that users can visit a single source to discover interesting activities. Event organizers and participants share events with others through VanCal. Event planners use VanCal to check for possible scheduling conflicts, allowing them to make smarter decisions. Many people check the site regularly to find out what events they can attend each day.</p>
